# Node.js GitHub API Service

This is a Node.js service that utilizes GitHub APIs to allow users to query GitHub repositories by name. The service acts as middleware, passing through responses from GitHub to achieve the goal. It provides various information about the repositories. Additionally, users can request the readme file for a specific project if it is available.

Best practises and type safety are incorporated into the application. For API functionality, it uses Node.js frameworks like Express. The service is built to effectively manage several concurrent requests.
